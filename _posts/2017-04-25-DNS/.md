#Guest Lecture from Professor Reyzin

## DNS Review:

-> DNS issues from last time: a denial of service attack, a source of leaks since DNS is over UDP, you  
can fingerprint an entire webpage, and it can be spoofed to the wrong person

-> How to spoof DNS to the wrong person: (off path attack)
  *16 bit number is a query address
  *so you know what request to resolve ie why caching a comcast is a better idea
  *if you're the bad guy, you want your response to beat out the right DNS request
  *also the query id returned by the attacker has to match
  *if this attack succeeds you can poision thier cache for at least 7 days every time they go to bu.edu

### How are the query Id's generated? (Question from a student)
  *so go to the webpage - know the query id
  *then ask bu.edu and find that QID
  *the scenerio explained above allows us to use that
  
### How can the attacker see if they suceeded? (Question from student)
  *make another request to bu.edu on your website
  * so if you succeed you will find out immediately as they will go to the attacker when it calls bu.edu
  
## Kaminsky Attack scenerio:

Every case for the attacker now: fixed port and sequential ID --> learn these values when attackers innocent website is visited 
because DNS query will go to the attacker's name server

####attack scenerio:
  *force you to do this many times -> embed a ton of images with empty domains
attackers webpage:
--------         
| aaxyz@bu.edu     - all nonexistent domains
| aaxyz2@bu.edu    - requests are guaranteed! many requests guaranteed
|    ...
|      |
--------
  *more DNS requests
  *going to be open for a longer time (bigger attack window)
  *eliminates the possibility that the website the victim looks up is already cached (wouldn't work)
  *non-existant means the victim will have to ask about it: ie many reuqests will come!
  *in response to these queries:
    1.response will redirect to another name server, operated by the attacker
    2. fake glue record returned by the attackers' name server
    
    aaxyz@bu.edu ------->    ns1@bu.edu    NS- ( a real name: bu.edu)  
                          <--------------- A- atackers ip address
### Review of DNS nameserver lookup:
  *NS record will return IP address 
  *a nameserver and its IP address is called a glue record
### Now attacker can poision nameserver
  *everytime you go to find bu.edu you will go to the attacker (one step up from the first attack)
  *now the name server is poisioned in the cache
### Kaminsky attack is better:
  * more requests
  * saying we don't know and redirecting it NA and poisioning it
  * could poision comcast cache to google payoff is super high
### Solutions:
  *QID randomization -2^16 security (kaminsky attack still doable in 10s)
  *Port randomization (another 11 bits of security 2^27 overall)
  *(8.8.8.8 google's resolver you can play with)

## DNS SEC:
  *why not sign DNS like certificates from keys, so DNS maps and certs map:
  *  - key: domain value: PK
### what does DNS SEC do? it digitally signs DNS and it adds a  new record type called RRSIG
  *RRSIG: Resource record signatures
ex.
www.google.com A --many RR  
               A            
               A  --RRSIG -signs them all ( all signed with ZSK -- explained later on)
### Problems:
  *you still want to fit into UDP - don't want length in the DNS
  *DDOS is amplified
#### student question: who signs?
  *DNS is heirarchial: so each time you go down the hierarchy you get a ket and check it against the NS key so you only need one root key
### simple verison:
  *new record typeL DS ("Delegation signer") comes together with NS
  #ex. bu.edu (comes with RRSIG) and has NS (ns1@bu.edu) and DS (heres the hash of the public key)
## Key rollover:
  * what happens: 90% of the headache in PK, are very hard to do, want to be able to do rollovers but keys are long
  * solution: 2 keys at everystep
    1. a key signing key (KSK) that sits above a ZSK
    2. ZSK is a zone signing key
  * each zone has 2 DNS key records - one for KSK and one for ZSK
  * not terribly inefficient- nowyou can roll over you zsk on your own - easy
note(look up DNS key signing ceremony)

## Last thoughts:
  *what about a negative response? How do you autheticate it: can't presign a no for every scenerio
  *DNS solutions:
    1. going to sign executive pairs of things that exist
    2. NSEC (next secure) contains the next name in alphabetical order
    3. prove that a name does not exist
    4. concerns about this: if there is a bogus query, the attacker can get 2 legitimate names after and before,
    and you can keep going ( zone walking : avenue for attack )
